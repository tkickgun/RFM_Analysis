# RFM_Analysis
A simple implementation of Recency Frequency and Monetary Analysis of a Retail Market to identify and segment potential customers. These insights can be particularly helpful for targeted advertising and campaigns featuring discounts to the potential customers.

# RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation
## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis used to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The analysis helps in identifying high-value customers, understanding their behavior, and making data-driven decisions to improve business revenue.

## Project Structure
Data Loading: Load the sales data into a DataFrame and ensure proper data types for efficient processing.
Revenue Calculation: Calculate the revenue generated per order considering unit price, discounts, and costs.
RFM Calculation: Aggregate the RFM metrics:
Recency: Days since the last purchase.
Frequency: Number of orders placed by the customer.
Monetary: Total revenue generated by the customer.
RFM Scoring: Rank customers into quintiles based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values, assigning scores accordingly.
Segmentation: Group customers based on their RFM scores and sort them to identify top-value segments.

## Business Insights
What Insights Can Be Extracted?
1. Customer Segmentation:
  i) Identify loyal customers with high Frequency and Monetary scores.
 ii) Detect at-risk customers with low Recency and Frequency scores.
iii) Highlight high-potential customers with low Frequency but high Monetary scores.

2. Targeted Marketing:
  i) Focus marketing efforts on high-value segments (e.g., cross-sell, upsell).
 ii) Re-engage at-risk customers with personalized offers or discounts.
iii) Reward loyal customers with special incentives to retain them.

3. Revenue Improvement:
i) Increase retention rates by focusing on customers with declining Recency scores.
ii) Optimize promotional strategies for different customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.
iii) Enhance customer lifetime value (CLV) by strategically targeting segments most likely to respond to marketing efforts.


## How Can It Improve Store Revenue?
Personalized Campaigns: By segmenting customers, the store can tailor marketing campaigns to each segment's unique needs, leading to higher conversion rates.
Customer Retention: Identifying and re-engaging customers who haven't purchased recently can reduce churn and boost revenue.
Cross-Selling Opportunities: Targeting customers with a high RFM score for related products can increase the average order value.
